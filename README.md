# Creditworthiness Prediction with Machine Learning  
A project aimed at predicting the creditworthiness of loan applicants using Machine Learning models.  

## Project Overview  
This project leverages **Machine Learning** to help a bank efficiently process a surge in loan applications by identifying creditworthy applicants. The models predict whether an applicant qualifies for a loan, assisting the bank in making informed decisions.  

In addition to accurate predictions, the bank’s management team is interested in understanding the key factors influencing the model’s decisions for improved strategy and transparency.  

## Objectives  
1. Develop and evaluate various **Classification Models** to predict applicant eligibility for loans.  
2. Identify and highlight the most important features influencing predictions to aid in managerial decision-making.  

## Project Workflow  

1. **Data Importation**  
   - Load the dataset and prepare it for analysis.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, and Feature Engineering**  
   - Explore the dataset, clean missing or inconsistent data, and engineer relevant features for better predictive performance.  

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Prepare the data for modeling by applying necessary transformations such as encoding, scaling, and splitting.  

4. **Model Development**  
   - Build multiple classification models to predict creditworthiness.  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

6. **Model Selection**  
   - Choose the best-performing model for deployment.  

7. **Feature Importance Analysis**  
   - Analyze the model to identify the most influential features driving its predictions.  

8. **Project Summary**  
   - Summarize the results, insights, and recommendations for the management team.
